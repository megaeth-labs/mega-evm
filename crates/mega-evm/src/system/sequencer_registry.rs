//! The `SequencerRegistry` system contract.
//!
//! It holds the two rotating roles of the chain — the system address and the sequencer — and
//! their change schedules. It runs its own bytecode: no method of it is intercepted, so a call
//! to it is an ordinary call. Its Solidity source is
//! `crates/system-contracts/contracts/SequencerRegistry.sol`.
//!
//! Reading the rotated system address out of its storage, and the pre-block call that applies a
//! due change, belong to system contract deployment and the pre-block system calls.
